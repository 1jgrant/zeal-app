## About

Zeal is a social activity app that allows friends to get creative and collectively partake in regular photography challenges on different topics, wherever they are. Each user-created group has a list of challenges to work through, which include topics like portraits, nature, black and white, and more. After submitting that challenge's entry, a user can then see how their friends fared and vote for their favourite. Think you can take better photos than your mates? Prove it!

This app was made as a final project of the Northcoders bootcamp in a team of 4 over 2 weeks.
